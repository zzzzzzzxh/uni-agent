"""Per-execution logging built on the stdlib ``logging`` module.

A single dispatch handler on the root logger routes each record to its file by log ID.
The ID is carried implicitly by a ContextVar bound through :func:`sample_logging`.
A filtered console handler keeps stdout readable next to a progress bar.

Runtimes pass a :class:`LogContext` across process boundaries and bind it in the
process that executes the workload.
